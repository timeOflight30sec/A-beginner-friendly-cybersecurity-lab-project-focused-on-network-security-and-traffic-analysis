# Cybersecurity Home Lab Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation and configuration of a beginner-friendly cybersecurity home lab. It focuses on setting up a secure network, monitoring traffic, and simulating attacks.

## Objectives
- Set up a secure virtualized network using VMware/VirtualBox.
- Configure and test a firewall with pfSense.
- Monitor network traffic using Wireshark.
- Simulate basic penetration testing techniques using Kali Linux.

## Tools Used
- **Virtualization Software**: VirtualBox or VMware
- **Operating Systems**: Ubuntu Server, Kali Linux, Windows 10
- **Firewall**: pfSense
- **Traffic Analysis**: Wireshark
- **Penetration Testing Tools**: Nmap, Metasploit

## Steps
1. **Set Up Virtual Machines**
   - Created VMs for Kali Linux, Ubuntu Server, and Windows 10.
2. **Configure pfSense Firewall**
   - Blocked all inbound traffic by default.
   - Allowed specific outbound traffic for web and SSH.
3. **Host a Web Server**
   - Installed Apache on Ubuntu Server to simulate a web application.
4. **Monitor Traffic**
   - Captured and analyzed traffic using Wireshark.
5. **Simulate Attacks**
   - Conducted a vulnerability scan with Nmap.
   - Tested firewall rules by attempting unauthorized access.
